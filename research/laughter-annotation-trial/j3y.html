</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>5</font></td><td>Hello, well this week it's the turn of those listeners who've sent in their queries by post and we'll try and help as many of you as we can.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>6</font></td><td>Our team is Daphne <em>[last or full name]</em> from Spalding, Fred <em>[last or full name]</em> from Lancaster and Walter <em>[last or full name]</em> from East Kilbride and our first card this week is er, <em>&lt;laughing&gt;</em>:[ goes back into ] our own experiences because it's from Gill <em>[last or full name]</em> of West Yorkshire.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>7</font></td><td>Some of you may remember her because we stayed at her hotel er a little while ago and <em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em> she has a lovely horse chestnut tree er outside her hotel and since we went <em>&lt;laughing&gt;</em>:[ it stopped producing conkers ].</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>8</font></td><td>She says has it turned gay or homosexual, has it changed sex, is it the micro-climate or did one of us fix it?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>9</font></td><td>Just to remind us the tree is five hundred feet above sea level.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>10</font></td><td>It's always the first tree to leaf and it's also the first one to shed its leaves in the area and all the neighbouring horse chestnut trees, which presumably we didn't tamper with <em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em> have stayed prolific.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>11</font></td><td>Fred did you knob all the conkers?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>12</font></td><td>No I didn't Stefan, we've been blamed for some things in our time, <font COLOR=Gray>haven't we but </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td></td><td><font COLOR=Gray><em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em> </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>13</font></td><td>nothing like this I don't think.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>14</font></td><td>If I remember rightly this erm hotel is on a hill, isn't it?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>15</font></td><td>Certainly, five hundred feet up, yes.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>16</font></td><td>But it's on a hill in the, in the, in the <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em>, it's a long way down from there to walk and, and if I remember rightly it was on the outside of the hotel, on a bank and that to me means that erm if we had had some weather, which we had at that time, then the roots could have suffered but the other clue I think is that erm it comes into leaf first and it drops its leaves first in the autumn so maybe it's a different tree than the other, different variety, because there are several horse chestnuts aren't there?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>17</font></td><td>Yes, there's the normal horse chestnut which is aesculus hippocastanum <font COLOR=Maroon>that's </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>18</font></td><td><font COLOR=Maroon>Yes. </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>19</font></td><td>the one with the big <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> on but then there's  pavia <em>[sic]</em> isn't there
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>20</font></td><td>Yes.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>21</font></td><td>which is the red flowered one
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>22</font></td><td>And some of these are a bit tender, more tender than the others aren't they as well?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>23</font></td><td>But they don't actually produce as many conkers.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>24</font></td><td>So I'm just wondering whether this is a different variety and because it was two years ago, I <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> three years ago now I think.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>25</font></td><td>That year I can remember was a good year wasn't it?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>26</font></td><td>We had a good spring and we had a good set in year.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>27</font></td><td>We got a cold gust of er icy winds when that I think was out in blossom then there wouldn't be many conkers.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>28</font></td><td>Well, no, there wouldn't but what's so odd is that the other horse chestnut trees in the area seem alright.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>29</font></td><td><em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> Walter, I know you weren't there Walter so we can't blame you for whatever's happened but have you got a theory about it?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>30</font></td><td>Well er you know it seems such a mystery er to me, conker not shy.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>31</font></td><td>There are all sorts of situations that can occur, I've heard of electrical er and soil impulses that er cause shock and well might put it out to flower.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>32</font></td><td>Again er even frosting blast when even other trees er specific trees are erm alright, it may have been caught in that draught and set it back a little, you never know.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>33</font></td><td>No, it's er <s> d </s> Gill <em>[last or full name]</em> er goes on actually to ask, she says do <s> d </s> do these trees have to cross pollinate?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>34</font></td><td>Well they don't in fact Gill <em>[last or full name]</em>, in fact horse chestnuts are rather interesting, that technically what's called  andromonetius <em>[sic]</em> which means they have male flowers and hermaphrodite flowers on the same, so it's hedging its bets all ways round.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>35</font></td><td>Er yeah it is Stefan but because you know it's the first one to come into leaf and <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> the first one to shed, then possibly it will flower at a different time as well I would think and that may be the clue.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>36</font></td><td>Yes perhaps you're right Fred.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>37</font></td><td>Well we don't have a definite answer erm Gill <em>[last or full name]</em> but we think it may have experienced a shock of some sort during that season and of course when this happens to fruit trees they can go into bi-annual cropping and then they come back again, it may be that this horse chestnut's experienced something very similar.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>38</font></td><td>I think the answer is we must come and stay with you again and then we can <em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>39</font></td><td>And the other thing of course Stefan is it lives in Yorkshire.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>40</font></td><td>Well I <font COLOR=Red><em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> that lives in Ilkley. </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td></td><td><font COLOR=Red><em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em> </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>41</font></td><td>On Ilkley Moor bar conkers.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>42</font></td><td>Anyway, we'll <s> tr </s> we'll come back and see your tree again Gill <em>[last or full name]</em>.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>43</font></td><td>Thank you for the question.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>44</font></td><td>We go to London now and to, to erm, sorry I'm <s> j </s> see what sex this <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> honest we don't know what sex it's from M <em>[last or full name]</em>, could be Mr Mrs Ms. M <em>[last or full name]</em> of London has been told that their plum tomatoes have got T M V.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>45</font></td><td>Fred will tell you in a moment what T M V is but the symptoms are the plants have brown blotches on the stems, fallen leaves all round where <s> th </s> where the plants are growing erm and he's done all he can to get rid of it.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>46</font></td><td>He's got rid of the old plants, he's, but he's kept the seeds, this is interesting, he's kept the seeds from apparently unaffected plants.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>47</font></td><td>The fruit itself seem to be alright and the bottom line of the question, is it safe to replant the seeds from this plant next season?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>48</font></td><td>So it's your question, Fred.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>49</font></td><td>First of all, what is T M V?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>50</font></td><td>Well it's tomato mosaic virus int it, erm but what really is significant about it is that the leaves are mottled with yellow and it quite often go fern like, they go very very thin.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>51</font></td><td>Er and this erm virus actually will er stay in the seed, it will stay in the soil, it will stay in the soil for years and <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> plant other varieties, or other er plants in there.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>52</font></td><td>So I think I would do away with my plum tomatoes for a start with something else.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>53</font></td><td>We all think it's going to stay there for a long time and, and there are varieties now, bred specially to be immune from er T M V and er, we use things like Counter or Curabell, or one of my favourites of course Shirley.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>54</font></td><td>Yes, yeah it is one of the most infectious of all plant viruses
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>55</font></td><td>Yeah.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>56</font></td><td>er it spreads as you say by contact and in the seed, this is the point, so I wouldn't save seeds from any plants that have been anywhere near
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>57</font></td><td>No because even the ones that aren't showing the symptoms, they could have the virus in it, cos it just may not have come out.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>58</font></td><td>Yes.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>59</font></td><td>So I wouldn't save it at all I would do away with the lot.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>60</font></td><td>Yeah, just as a, as a side issue, I am interested that they've been growing plum tomatoes because each year I hear of more and more people growing plum tomatoes successfully in this country and while we are just on the subject of diseases and things to control them, you may remember that a few weeks ago we were giving advice on how we should dispose of waste garden chemicals and, and we said you ought to pour it down an outside drain.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>61</font></td><td>Well, apparently that used to be the official advice er and, and we were correct in that but the authorities have now changed their minds and they no longer want us to pour waste chemical down the drains and I gather that the official advice now is that surplus diluted chemical should be poured, and I'm quoting here, <em>&lt;reading&gt;</em>:[ on to more or less level and bare soil in the garden or on to level gravelled paths, avoid disposal in areas around ponds, erm water courses and so forth, dishes and, and what have you ] and as far as undiluted chemicals are concerned, that's stuff still in the bottle, the advice there is to talk to your local authority cos they have different regulations in different areas.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>62</font></td><td>If anyone wants chapter and verse on this the erm address of the British Agro-chemicals Association who put out this literature will be on our fact sheet.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>63</font></td><td>Right we move on to er the West Country now and Owen <em>[last or full name]</em> of Wareham in Dorset.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>64</font></td><td>Er now Owen <em>[last or full name]</em> has a large summer house and collects rain water from the roof and the roof's been covered recently with a good quality, he says, mineralized felt.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>65</font></td><td>Now remember some years ago, and I remember this, that we said that it would inadvisable to collect rain water off a new felt roof.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>66</font></td><td>What he wants to know Daphne is, for how long should he wait?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Gray><em>Daphne</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>67</font></td><td>Well theoretically I would wait as long as it took to wash the mess off the roof.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>68</font></td><td>Now of course it would depend very much on and whether you were in a drought situation as we were until last year or whether it's like we've been over this last summer and early winter which is that virtually not a day has passed without we've had some rain, in which case obviously the roof is going to get cleaned up very much quicker but I have to say that although I've always been under the impression that it's not a good idea to save water off a new felt roof er because of deposits that come off the mineral felt.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>69</font></td><td>I have actually used water that's come off it and I've also had er sheds with plants growing underneath and I can't honestly remember, I mean I have obviously not used it on really sensitive plants like tomatoes which I think would show signs of stress.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>70</font></td><td>Now I've used it elsewhere in the garden and I've never really had any problem with it except it is inclined to make the water very alkaline because the chippings that are quite often used on a flat roof and they've got a very high P H and therefore you've got to be aware that the water that comes off is not likely to be soft it's more likely to be <s> fair </s> fairly hard but for reasonably tough plants I don't think I would waste it, especially in times of water shortage.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>71</font></td><td>Well Walter, have you experienced this as a problem?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>72</font></td><td>Well up in Scotland of course we don't need to save our rain water we get plenty of it coming from the <em>&lt;laughing&gt;</em>:[ unclear ], but er one thing I would say would be that erm if we have a warm spell and the sun is beating on a bitumen roof and then of course suddenly a shower and that er goes into the water bucket or water barrel then it does give you maybe you know a few problems.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>73</font></td><td>I remember having a problem like that where we were erm we had a, a load of erm <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> we were watering that material it was warmed, we thought of course would be alright but they did er, they were quite sensitive to it and they looked quite miserable.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>74</font></td><td>Yes Fred do you, would you, how long would you wait to collect the <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em>?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>75</font></td><td>Well I think I would wait Stefan until the oily film had gone off the top of the water for tender plants but then I am one of these people that would always tender plants with tap water anyway because you never know what's in do you in rain water, anything can congregate in a pot, it can be infected with all sorts of things and I would just use this water on the garden in the first twelve months or so or use it on shrubs and things like that if it was required and then go on to er things like perennials but <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> then you could use it on almost anything but with the proviso that you may have contamination in that water if it's from Water Board.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>76</font></td><td>But let's just remind people that, yes, water should be saved, water should be conserved.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>77</font></td><td>You may not need to do it in Scotland as well to the <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> in England.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>78</font></td><td>Many areas, yes, let's everybody have water butts and use them to, to save the rain water during next summer, next summer being when it's going to rain.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=White><em>Unknown</em></td><td></td><td><em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>79</font></td><td>We go to Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire now and Mrs Jennifer <em>[last or full name]</em> 's written to us er with a puzzle because she's found what she thought was an interesting plant growing amongst a raspberry bush in her garden.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>80</font></td><td>Her mother identified it as a wayfaring tree and she'd been cutting it back during the summer and it didn't seem to mind but she'd be very grateful for any information about the wayfaring tree which presumably she'd like to keep and continue to grow in her garden.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>81</font></td><td>Walter, what, what is a wayfaring tree?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>82</font></td><td>Well Jennifer I think it's er viburnum lanterna and it's quite an interesting er bush because it was in the sixteenth century a <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> er gave the tree its poetic name as he frequently come across it in old drove roads er over and across the old drove roads in the chalk downs of er from Winchester to Epsom and London but sorry about this it can grow to fifteen feet and in May it opens up its cluster of white flowers and it's really quite an attractive thing but the berries I don't think are so attractive so I <font COLOR=Purple>think erm </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>83</font></td><td><font COLOR=Purple><s> Des </s> </font>describe them why in what way they're not attractive one.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>84</font></td><td>Well they, they grow from this er green to white to red and then finally black, don't like black berries Stefan so <em>&lt;laughing&gt;</em>:[ that would be a no no as far as I was concerned in my garden ].
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>85</font></td><td>Oh alright well it's a no no for Walter's <font COLOR=Fuchsia>garden. </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td></td><td><font COLOR=Fuchsia><em>&lt;laugh&gt;</em> </font>
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>86</font></td><td>Daphne, is it a yes yes for your garden?
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Gray><em>Daphne</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>87</font></td><td>Well it's not a yes yes for the garden because I wouldn't have room for it but it's certainly a yes yes in my shelter  delt <em>[sic]</em> because the birds love the berries and it really encourages them to use that shelter  delt <em>[sic]</em> but it isn't as, as easy to grow, it's, one tends to think of the nature plant as a tough plant but I've been trying to establish about thirty of these in the shelter  delt <em>[sic]</em> and I've found they object to any form of total weedkiller round the root, so all the, the weedkillers that you would use for the first couple of years maybe to, to keep the, the weeds from growing round the stems, they tend to get chlorotic and die.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>88</font></td><td>They also don't like wind rock so in a, an exposed position young plants do really need more staking than you'd probably give a bush because they tend to rot off at the roots if they grow around a lot.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>89</font></td><td>I, I think it's quite a, an interestingly pretty plant in the right sort of situation but it is a wild plant, it is a native plant and it gets big.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>90</font></td><td>I am intrigued if it doesn't like wind rock, how it manages to survive on the drove roads over the downs that where Gerard <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em>.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Gray><em>Daphne</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>91</font></td><td>Well I think, I think that the difference is that if you're, they were obviously establishing themselves from seed and they picked the right spot and they got themselves anchored.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>92</font></td><td>If you're buying them as young plants which are probably a foot fifteen inches high then it takes them a couple of years to get the roots established.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>93</font></td><td>When they get big there's no problem at all, it's just that couple of years getting them settled down.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>94</font></td><td>Yeah, you, yes.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>95</font></td><td>Fred you presumably know this plant.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>96</font></td><td>Yeah I do Stefan, I mean <s> i </s> it's very vigorous int it, when it gets established and it grows very upright as well and of course it's deciduous erm some people call it a shrub, some people call it a tree but I, I will think that er Mrs <em>[last or full name]</em> is doing the right thing by cutting it back, especially if it's a small garden, it would make a better bush in the garden I think if she does that and <s> the </s> these little white flowers really in <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> are nice aren't they?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>97</font></td><td>I would grow it, yeah.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>98</font></td><td>Mm.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>99</font></td><td>I think ideally what we're saying er Mrs <em>[last or full name]</em> is that it's er, it's an interesting plant and being a native plant of course there'll be wild life that feeds on it which is to the good but it's probably a plant for a, a larger wilder garden really.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>100</font></td><td>Yeah, didn't it used to <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> called twistwood Stefan or something?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>101</font></td><td>If I remember rightly.
</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Fuchsia><em>Stefan</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>102</font></td><td>You could be right Fred I don't, I've not heard that one.

</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>114</font></td><td>Well I'm sure that soil does have some effect on potatoes Stefan, I mean if you get erm potatoes from down Lincolnshire, somewhere like that where it's er quite hard soil then, then you'll find that they will stay longer in the water before they boil away.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>115</font></td><td><s> I </s> if you get them off some of the mosses up our way, then they boil away far quicker but the other thing I think is mainly variety.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>116</font></td><td>Now things like erm, well one of my old favourites  Arran Pilot <em>[sic]</em> <s> i </s> if you dig it out when it's young, then of course it stays as it should, cos it's a very very waxy potato but, but I can remember growing varieties like Majestic and things like that and I mean they would never fall, they would never fall in the water but <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> they make good chips er of the modern varieties I think I'd go for er Kondor with a K er which is a very very good potato and does stay as it is <s> i </s> in the ground but one other thing I think also comes into it.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>117</font></td><td>Maybe these potatoes have been lifted too early.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>118</font></td><td>Now if you think about commercial potatoes and the ones that keep, the late ones, they are always harvested after the <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> have died down, a long time after, in fact some of them are still digging up potatoes now.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>119</font></td><td>So the skins of those potatoes are very very ripe and so is the flesh.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>120</font></td><td>A lot of people in the garden are digging them round about August September time <em>&lt;pause&gt;</em> really which is too early to keep potatoes and then the flesh is far softer.

</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Green><em>Walter</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>123</font></td><td>Yes, well up here in Scotland er where I live erm the maincrop variety Golden Wonder tends to certainly need a par boiling and a par boiling only er when cooking so it needs about what five to six minutes or something like that but erm any more and the tatties go to mash and er that's why I think a lot of the Golden Wonders er in Scotland are cooked in their skins but erm if I was to go for a variety that er I enjoy would be one called Pentland Ivory, it's a, a nice flowery spud er and you get quite a plentiful supply of them too so it's quite a good variety but you know the old Kerr's Pink used to be called I think Henry's Seedling, I remember rightly and then it changed its name to Kerr's Pink because Kerr was a seedsman up in <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> who really introduced it and er that was just after the first world war and that's a good one, that's a very good one and it's got that waxy skin as well you see so it might be quite useful.

</td></tr><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=Purple><em>Fred</em></td><td><font SIZE=-2>132</font></td><td>Well I think as an early potato Stefan, I would chose from Rocket for the earliest, I would grow I think for as well as that I would go for Foremost but if you want a real waxy potato it would still be Arran Pilot cos now whenever you eat it it <em>&lt;unclear&gt;</em> got a strong taste, whether it's young or whether it's old.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>133</font></td><td>As a late potato, as a keeping potato I always grow  Wilger <em>[sic]</em> Now I grow  Wilger <em>[sic]</em> because it, it browns well when it's roasted.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>134</font></td><td>It makes good chips or if it's dry fried.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font SIZE=-2>135</font></td><td>We, very seldom that we have boiled potatoes but if I wanted a potato I think to cover all the needs to keep, I would go for Desiree because that one will fit almost any bill at all, it'll do everything, it's the best all round potato, late potato that I have ever grown and eaten.
